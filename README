NAME
    Net::HTTP::Methods::patch::log_request - Patch module for
    Net::HTTP::Methods

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
     use Net::HTTP::Methods;
     use Net::HTTP::Methods::patch::log_request
       -on_unknown_version => 'warn',
       -on_conflict        => 'warn';

     # now all your LWP HTTP requests are logged

     use LWP::UserAgent;
     my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;
     my $response = $ua->get('...');

DESCRIPTION
    This module patches LWP::Protocol::http so that raw HTTP request is
    logged using Log::Any. If you look into LWP::Protocol::http's source
    code, you'll see that it is already doing that (albeit commented):

      my $req_buf = $socket->format_request($method, $fullpath, @h);
      #print "------\n$req_buf\n------\n";

FAQ
  Why not subclass?
    By patching, you do not need to replace all the client code which uses
    LWP.
